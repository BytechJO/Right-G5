While Helen and her friend were making a snowman, Helen's cat, Mimi, walked into the woods. Helen couldn't find her cat anywhere. Helen was feeling sad. There was a man walking near the bridge. He called to Helen. Are you looking for something? Yes, I'm looking for my brown cat. Have you seen it? No, I haven't, the man answered. Helen saw her classmate, Lana. Hi, Helen. How are you? asked Lana. I'm okay, but I've lost my cat, Mimi. I've been looking everywhere for her. I'm sorry. I haven't seen your cat, but I'll help you look for her, said Lana. Helen and Lana saw cat tracks. They went up the hill. The snow was deep. They walked on and on. Hey, that's my grandma's house, shouted Helen excitedly. That's great, replied Lana. I can't wait to see my grandma, said Helen happily. Grandma said, Hello, Helen and Lana. It's good to see you both. Come inside. It's very cold outside.",
