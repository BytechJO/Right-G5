Hansel wanted to take a picture with his camera. Oh, no! cried Hansel. What's wrong? asked Philip. I want to take some pictures, but I can't find my camera anywhere. I forgot where I put it, complained Hansel. Philip said, I'll help you look for your camera. What does it look like? It's white, and it has a long band, replied Hansel. Can you help us, Mom? asked Philip. We are looking for Hansel's camera. Philip's mom said, Sure, boys. I saw Stella taking a picture of her friends with a camera. That might be Hansel's camera. Thanks, Mom, said Philip. Stella was looking at some pictures she had taken with her camera. She said happily, Look, Hansel, I took some nice pictures. Do you want to look at them?",
